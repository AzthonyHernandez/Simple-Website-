        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="images/unnamed.jpg" class = "me">
        <p>My name is Anthony Hernandez. I am an ASC scholar and a summer intensive alumni. Since my summer intensive, I have entered my senior year in High School. I am enrolled in AP CSA and plan to get my master's in CompSci for college. I will also be graduating from my 4-year software engineering program in my High School, High School of Telecommunications Arts and Technology. I want to return to ASC as a teaching fellow to give back to the ASC family and be that person that my instructors were to me during my summer intensive. ASC provided the opportunity to become more confident in this field. I am now learning Java and Swift iOS thanks to that confidence. </p>
